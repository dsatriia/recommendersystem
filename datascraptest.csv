This is an opportunity to join a dynamic and integrated technical services team in the Corporate office, working closely with existing operations, new mine development projects, and supporting new business growth opportunities.  The Technical Services team are responsible for technical due diligence of growth opportunities, concept to feasibility studies for mine sustaining and growth projects, life-of-mine and mine closure business planning, defining the mine development strategy and mine operating plan, and governance of high risk technical disciplines. The Technical Services team comprises an internal Principals group covering all major technical disciplines, supporting by an internal senior technical team and consultants.  Our Assets  In Laos, PanAust owns a 90 per cent interest in the Lao-registered company, Phu Bia Mining Limited. The Government of Laos owns the remaining 10 per cent.
